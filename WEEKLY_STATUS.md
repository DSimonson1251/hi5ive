This week the team was still learning the relevant technologies for the project, making headway in flask, react, and mongodb. 
The review for the proposed data model for the database was completed.
We compared two visions for the application, by looking at proposed wire frames. We then decided on an overall direction for the app and general user experience flow. 
The team also completed a demonstrate and learning session for our github workflow. 

Next week the team will be working on starting the homepage, login page and signup pages and routes, as well as implementing the database model and populating it with dummy data.

The team is making changes to reducing pull request reviews required to 1 from 2. As well as starting to pair programm as needed.
